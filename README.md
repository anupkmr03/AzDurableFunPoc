# AzDurableFunPoc

Durable Functions is an extension of Azure Functions that lets you write stateful functions in a serverless environment. The extension lets you define stateful workflows by writing orchestrator functions. Behind the scenes, the extension manages state, checkpoints, and restarts for you, allowing us to focus on your business logic. 

Azure Durable Functions Version used for POC is: 2.5
